## Unit Assignment: Kudos Board

Submitted by: Blessing Amoah

Deployed Application (optional): [Kudos Board Deployed Site](https://frontend-srx7.onrender.com)

My render works but because I added the login feature and it runs on the localhost server. It is not possible for the render to open if the server is not running so if in case you want to test to see if my deployment works with the link provided then you will need to fork it and run the server on your local machine which the host is 3002. If there is anything I can share a video of it working.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I think the lab really helped but the only problem I have was the way it requirement was structured it was vague and I asked in the workplace but did not get any response about it because in the milestone it was saying something different and the board requirement was also saying something different.



* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I would try to check on the API because it was not working for my Meta email. I would work on the user log in authentication and also the other stretch features.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think everything went well.


### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

I did a google search and also asked Metamate bunny and chatGPT if I am stucked.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

My Manager and all TFs and Instructors.
